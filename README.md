# ALAB-317.1.1
Created with CodeSandbox

The provided CodeSandbox has a variety of errors that are not immediately apparent, and fixing them at runtime could prove tedious. Bugs may not immediately present themselves, and we do not want the end user to be the one that finds them!
Convert the provided index.js into a TypeScript file, index.ts simply by renaming it.
TypeScript has already been installed and configured in this Sandbox, so this should be a simple process. When complete, change the reference from index.js to index.ts within the index.html file, and include the @ts-check comment at the top of index.ts to enable error checking.
